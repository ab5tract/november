This is the JANITORS file, where small p5w tasks are written down so that they
are not forgotten. Since the tasks are often fairly low-hanging fruit, many of
them are likely to be good starting-points for volunteers.

If there's an item appearing here which has already been implemented, feel
free to remove it.

* Rethink the exact layout of the login screen.

* Refine the time indications in recent changes. (Right now they are just
  seconds since epoch.)

* Add 'return_to' links for the login and logout actions. And maybe redirects,
  or at least manual links.

* Implement 'created new page' flag in recent-changes.

* Implement 'minor edits'.

* Think about the pre- and postconditions of every subroutine. For example,
  read_old_page currently assumes that $revision lies in the right interval
  (1..$latest). Implement checks so that the wiki engine never crashes from
  this kind of user input. Document pre- and postconditions.

* Add a nice little message 'You are viewing an old revision of this page'
  to the view-old-revision pages.

* Add nice little '<- go to previous edition' and 'go to next revision ->'
  to the view-old-revision pages. Provided such previous/next revisions
  exist, of course.

* Make the CSS stylesheet adhere to a baseline grid
  <http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Vertical_Motion/2.2.2/>
  <http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb/>

* It would probably be a good idea to make the contents of the files in
  data/modifications/ hash references instead of array references. Right now,
  different fields are indexed by number, which is quite opaque.

* Add ability to edit old revision pages. This should be accompanied by a
  "Warning: this is an old revision you're editing." and a link to editing
  the latest version of the page.

* Don't save an edit unless anything is changed.

* Consider following this advice:
  <http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=622185&cid=24295989>

* Implement creating new users. CAPTCHA?
